We implemented our program using several tools, most closely linked to the last finance pset.

Perhaps, the most important design decision we made is implementing our code in python. Python is imple, user-friendly and easy to use. Aslo, with the last psets,
we had gained exposure to making websites using python as the main algorithmic language. Thus, we continued on with Python for our final project as well.
Then, since our website requires that the users register and also that they fill out a form for opening the project, we used sql to create tables that stores
data. sql is again very ease and efficient to use unlike for example csv which is less convenient.

We used bootstrap to make the login, register and the project opening forms. Also, we used javascript to check whether the username is available. This allowed
for a clientside checking before the server-side checking became active.

One important design decision that we made was to use Google forms to enable users to create a form. Initially, we wanted users to be able to generate any form
within our own website; however, we soon figured out that that was hard to achieve. Thus, we use google forms and the link that is generated to store the created
forms within our own website.

We used multiple html templates for the several pages that open within our website. In addition, we spent some time deciding on the styling of our website.
The InFeed colors were selected so as to make it the most aestheitcally appealing. Also, the overall pink background of the website suits the casual and fun use
of the webiste to collect information. Also, the pink color caused the least disturbance to the visiblity of text in several parts of the website.

The highlight of our project is using google's APIs to allow sign-in using google. This was soemthing that required a lot of research and time. However, we were
able to get the sign in to work. However, we would still have liked if we could have allowed alternate sign-in into the webiste using google. As of now, the
website only accepts sign-in using the form that is on the website itself.
