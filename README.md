 Though the structure of your documentation is entirely up to you, it should be incredibly clear to the staff how and where, if applicable, to compile,
 configure, and use your project. Your documentation should be at least several paragraphs in length. It should not be necessary for us to contact you with
 questions regarding your project after its submission. Hold our hand with this documentation; be sure to answer in your documentation any questions that you
 think we might have while testing your work.

 The name of our website is InFeed. The basic role of the website is to enable users for example Harvard students to be able to collect information from other
 Harvard students about a topic of interest. The user will open a project that he/she is interested in collecting data about and once the project is opened, it
 will be added to the the list of open projects under "Respond a Project". Any user who has logged in can then open any of those surveys and submit them. The
 results of the survey will be emailed to the person who created the project.

 When the website is opened, the user is displayed the login page by default. If users have registered before, they can login; else they can register by clicking
 "Register" on the top right of the screen. Once the users are registered, they are redirected to the homepage. From here on, users can either "Open a Project"
 or "Respond to a Project". When the users click "Open a Project", they are displayed a form asking the name of the project and the link to the google form of
 the project. The users are also provided with a link to go and create the google form. Once the users create the google form, they copy the link of the form and
 also in the Responses section of the google form, they provide their email address which will be used to send them the reponses to their survey form. The link
 is then copied on the form provided in the 'Open a Project' section. In order to ensure that the link is easily accessible to  everyone (since sometimes domain
 emails may place restrictions on who can view the email), users can change the google form settings by unchecking the box next to "Restrict to (domain) users".

 Once the users have opened a project, the project is added to the list of projects in the "Respond to Projects" tab. Then, users can select any of the forms
 and fill out the survey and submit it. The response will be sent to the person who created the project in the first place via email.

 We have also added the option for users to sign in sunig google. Right now, while the basic functionality works, the one problem that we were having is making
 the google sign in substitute for the "Log in" of the website. However, we were unable to acheive that. When we sign in using google, the website still requires
 registering through the website in order to display the homepage. That is one of the limitations of our program.

 Whenever the user goes to any page within the website, he/she is allowed to go back to the homepage by the hyperlink on bottomsaying "Back to homepage". Also,
 when users are done, they can log out by clicking the "Log out" button on the top of the website.
